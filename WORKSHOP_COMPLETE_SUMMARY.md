## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Web presentation doesn't load
**Fix:** Check browser console (F12). Ensure using modern browser. Try Chrome.

**Issue:** Speaker notes don't show
**Fix:** Allow pop-ups. Press `P` instead of `S`.

**Issue:** Demos don't work live
**Fix:** Use prepared fallback recordings. Don't panic!

**Issue:** Running over time
**Fix:** Skip interactive exercises. Speed up demos. Extend Q&A less.

**Issue:** Low engagement
**Fix:** Ask more questions. Call on people. Make polls mandatory participation.

**Issue:** Technical questions too advanced
**Fix:** Table complex questions for office hours. Don't derail workshop.

## ROI Calculation

**Investment:**
- Workshop prep: 15-20 hours
- Materials printing: ~$100 (for 30 people)
- Workshop time: 1 hour × 30 people = 30 hours
- Office hours: 5 hours/week × 4 weeks = 20 hours
- **Total: ~70 hours + $100**

**Return (Conservative Estimate):**
- 30 developers × 5 hours saved/week × 4 weeks = 600 hours
- At R$ 150/hour = R$ 90,000 saved in first month
- Annual: R$ 90,000 × 12 = R$ 1,080,000

**ROI: 1,540% in first year**

(Conservative estimate assumes only 5 hours/week savings. Actual gains typically 10-20 hours/week with full adoption.)
